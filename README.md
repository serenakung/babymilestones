# 👶 Baby Milestones App

A responsive web app that helps parents track their baby’s developmental milestones and activity ideas.  
Built during my maternity leave as part of my ongoing #100DaysOfCode journey.

---

## 💡 Overview
I created this app after struggling to find a clear and typo-free baby milestone infographic online.  
Using **GitHub Copilot**, I built a milestone checklist that automatically updates as parents select developmental goals.  
It started as a small personal project but quickly became a learning experiment in **AI-assisted coding, JSON data handling, and CSS troubleshooting**.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to **structure and read data** from a `data.json` file (and why it needs to be in the same directory as the HTML file).  
- Different ways to populate and manage data – manually, via Postman, or APIs.  
- How to **integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with Copilot suggestions, while understanding and verifying each step.  
- How to **use Git in the terminal** to commit and push changes to GitHub.  
- How to **debug CSS layout issues** when Copilot’s suggestions were repetitive or incorrect.  
- How to make layout responsive and separate style from structure (no inline CSS).  
- How to **deploy Node apps**, including understanding `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for dependency management.

## 🧩 Features
- ✅ Milestone checklists grouped by age range (0–12 months).  
- 🍼 “Select All” / “Deselect All” toggles replaced by cleaner **filter toggles**.  
- 📊 Dynamic counter that shows how many milestones are selected.  
- 📱 Fully responsive mobile layout with clean, minimal CSS styling.  
- 🧩 Data stored in JSON and displayed dynamically on the page.  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Convert project to **React** for better component and state management.  
- Add **activity ideas** linked to each milestone.  
- Enable **local storage** or cloud sync so progress isn’t lost on refresh.  
- Add optional **user login** or profile saving.  
- Improve accessibility with ARIA roles and screen-reader testing.

## 🧩 Reflection
Building this project taught me how to collaborate with AI tools effectively while staying in control of the logic and design.  
It was also my first project where I felt like a **developer solving problems independently** — I diagnosed layout bugs that Copilot missed, improved code clarity, and deployed everything myself.  
Most of all, it reminded me that coding can be both **creative and meaningful**, especially when building tools that serve real families like my own.
